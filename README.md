# Stoejbox_XYZ

A desktop synthesizer with an interface that features an XYZ controller, allowing users to simultaneously control multiple
sound parameters by moving fingers in the X-, Y- and Z-directions. It also includes a menu system that can be navigated using an encoder and push buttons, allowing the aforementioned
XYZ controller to be dynamically mapped to the sound parameters. This instrument was created by Benjamin Fullerton Støier for a semester project on his 1st semester of SMC at Aalborg University.
The instrument was also presented at the SMC-22 (Sound and Music Computing) conference in Saint-Étienne.
